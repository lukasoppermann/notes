## Tortenband

| Tart size | Ribbon length |
| --------- | ------------- |
| 7cm       | 23cm          |


## Tart rings
- My tart rings are 12,5cm ~ 5inches
- 40cm circumference
- 3 tarts a 12,5cm = 1 tart a 22cm = 9inch

For a 3mm pie dough you need about 160g of dough per ring.
Butter to insight of tart ring to make it sticky



# Tip
- To prevent sogginess egg-wash the inside of the pie crust before blind-baking
- Reheat pie from fridge for 10-20 minutes in a 160°C oven before serving.
- Add butter to insight of tart ring to make it sticky

### From Video
1. Mix Flour, Sugar and Salt
2. Grade Frozen Butter in Chees grater
3. Quickly mush butter into dough (dough should not get to warm) so it is mixed
4. Add Ice Water, starting with 60g, Mix it with fork (no kneading)
5. Add more ice water until you can merge all pieces into a dough ball
6. Pad it into disk and wrap into plastic wrap and store in fridge for 20min to 24h
7. After 20min, flour your surface and rolling pin (little bit) Roll out dough
	1. Roll from middle to one top, use dough knife to turn 45deg, repeat from middle to top, repeat until it is 13"
8. Roll dough up on rolling pin and unroll onto pie dish
9. Crimp edge
10. Freeze for 15-20 min to make it firm and make sure it does not shrink when baking
11. Preheat oven to 190°C
12. Blind bake at 190°C
	1. 15-20min with foil and weights
		1. Poke a few holes in bottom with fork
	2. Another 15-20 min without foil

#### Make the dough:
#### By hand:
- Freeze your butter for 10 minutes, or until very cold. Grate the butter using the large holes of a box grater (or using the grater attachment of your food processor – see below). Return grated butter to freezer for another 10 minutes. Alternatively, you can also shred frozen butter into shards using a sharp knife.
- In a deep, medium-sized mixing bowl, combine the flour, sugar, and salt. Add the cold grated butter, tossing to combine. Working quickly, use your hands to further cut and break the butter into pieces the size of small peas. You can also use a [pastry blender](https://amzn.to/3LBWGsL) or two knives.
- Drizzle a few tablespoons of water on the mixture and toss to moisten. Continue adding the remaining water until the dough sticks together and stays stuck when pressed between two fingers. It’s okay if the dough is still crumbly and messy.
- Turn the mixture out onto a clean work surface. Use your hands to press the dough together into a craggily mass. Gently fold one half of the dough over and onto itself, repeating this three times, until it’s come together into a cohesive mass.
- Use a [bench scraper](https://amzn.to/4637Fnd) to cut the dough in half (if making double crust). Wrap each half in plastic. Press down each plastic-wrapped dough to create a 4-inch wide disk shape. Refrigerate at least six hours, preferably overnight.
#### Roll out the dough:

- Let the dough sit at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, or until slightly pliable.

    
- Roll the dough out on a floured work surface. Keep turning the dough after every roll to ensure it doesn’t stick to the counter and is of even thickness. Add additional flour to the dough, the counter, and your rolling pin as needed. Roll out into a 12-inch circle about 1/8-inch thick.

- Gently roll the dough up and around the rolling pin, then unroll and drape over a 9-inch pie tin. Gently press into the pie tin, being careful to avoid stretching it to fit. Use scissors or a knife to trim the excess dough, leaving a 1-inch overhang. Fold the overhang under itself and crimp or flute. Pierce the base of the dough with a fork. 
- Repeat above rolling process if making a double crust pie.

- Wrap the dough in plastic and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight. At this point, consult your recipe directions for how to use the dough or follow options below.
	- Better **Freeze the un-cooked pie crust for at least 30 - 60 minutes, preferably an hour, before blind-baking**.
    


# Par-Bake:

Variant 1:
- place pie dough in dish
- poke holes into dough to let steam out
- put in freezer for 10-20min to make dough cool and hard before wrapping in aluminium foil
- tightly wrap everything in aluminium foil
- freeze for at lest 1h, better over night
- **NEXT DAY**
- Pre-heat oven to 175°C
- Take dough out and fill with pie weights
- Slow-bake at 175°C for 40-60 min
- Take out and remove aluminium foil and let cool down


Variant 2:
#### Bake dough:

- If the pie recipe calls for a prebaked shell, preheat the oven to 220°C. For an extra crispy bottom crust, place your oven rack on the bottom shelf and if you have one, bake on a preheated [baking stone](https://amzn.to/3qk4lE7).
    
- Line the chilled crust with baking paper. Fill the crust completely to the rim with pie weights, granulated sugar, rice, or dried beans.
    
- Place on a [rimmed baking pan](https://amzn.to/3GHs0Ut).
    
- To par-bake if baking again with filling:
    
- Bake for 15 to 17 minutes, or until just beginning to brown and no longer raw.
    

#### To bake completely:

- Bake for 20 minutes or until solidified. Remove foil and weights. Continue to bake until totally browned at the edges with light browning in the center, about another 7 to 10 minutes.

### Claire Saffitz Custard for 13" Pie or Tard
→ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DVh_EXHZsSQ)

- 456g whole milk
- 6g vanilla extract 
- 1g salt
- ~~100g~~ 60g sugar
- 40g cornstarch
- 5 large egg yolks (80g) 
- 85g unsalted butter, cut into 5 pieces, chilled

1. **Infuse Milk**
	- Put vanilla, salt and milk into a pot and let it **slowly** come up to a simmer
	- Milk only needs to steam, not more
2. **While milk is warming up: prepare rest**
	 -  Whisk sugar and cornstarch together to break up corn starch clumps in a **BIG bowl**
	 - Add Egg yolks and whisk together (keep going for long until it turns light pale and moussy)
		 - When drizzling back into bowl it sits on top and slowly spreads out
 3. **Tempering**
	 - slowly introduce hot into cold ingredients, otherwise egg cooks and curdles
	 - While whisking the egg mix, slowly add small bits (a tablespoon at a time) of milk and mix constantly
		 - Until 2/3 if milk is added
		 - add egg milk mix to pot with rest and constantly whisky fast and strong to avoid eggs from cooking
		 - When whisk leaves trails, shortly stop (max 5 sec) to see if it bubbles
		 - Once it bubbled take off heat but keep in pot and continue stirring for 30-60 sec
			 - cooked until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (→ [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hS6nfjOsoBw))
		 - transfer to a bowl and keep whisking
	 - Whisk in cold butter one piece at a time
	 - Once all butter is mixed in, transfer to tupper box and let cool.
		 - **NOTE:** Don't scrape bottom of pot, but leave it it, as it may be slightly burned
