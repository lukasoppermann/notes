## Orange cream
- 100ml milk
- 50ml orange juice
- ~~150g Whipping Cream~~ **(150g Milk + 6-8g of corn starch)**
- 1/4 tablespoon of vanilla bean paste
- 25g of corn starch (sieved) + 6-8g if using milk instead of whipping cre
- 35g sugar
- 15g butter
- Zest of 1/2 - 1 large orange

**Instructions:**
1. Add all of the ingredients into a large saucepan and whisk together to break up any large clumps and help the corn flour/ starch to incorporate a-little bit.
2. Place the saucepan on the hob over low / medium heat and allow to simmer.
3. Cook the custard for around 10 minutes, stirring to prevent sticking and burning. The mixture should be ready when you dunk a spoon into the it and it should coat the back of a spoon without running back into the pan. It’ll be thick custard like consistency. If the mixture develops any lumps, stir vigorously with a hand whisk or blend with a stick blender.
4. This mixture can set quickly, so pour directly onto the base and level off with an off set spatula. Place into the fridge and allow to chill for at least 6 hours until slightly firm and it holds it’s shape (you can even leave it overnight).

## Tempered dark chocolate
Add a thin layer of dark chocolate on top of the orange custard and let it dry before adding the curd.

## Orange curd
- 280 ml freshly squeezed orange juice
- Zest of one large orange
- 40 g sugar
- 40g corn starch
- 30 g unsalted butter

**Instructions:**
- In a saucepan, add the orange juice, zest and sugar and heat on low flame till sugar is dissolved (about 2-3 minutes).
- Slowly add the sieved corn starch and whisk well
- Keep whisking until the mixture starts to thicken (about 1-2 minutes).
- Add the butter and keep mixing till the butter is melted and you’ve reached your desired consistency. Switch off the flame.
- Pour it into a clean bowl and cover it with plastic wrap/cling such that it’s touching the top to avoid skin to form as it cools.
- Refrigerate the curd for at least 1 hour before using. The curd will continue to thicken as it cools. The curd can be refrigerated for up to 10 days.
