### Instructions

**Cream:** Put cream into freezer for up to 30 minutes before wisking it.
Also cool mixer sticks and cream bowl before using, especially in summer.

**Prepare the Gelatin:**
1. Sprinkle gelatin over lukewarm water in a small bowl
2. Let it bloom for 5 minutes at room temperature
3. After blooming, heat the mixture until dissolved
4. Strain any remaining lumps and let cool slightly

**Prepare the filling:**
1. Prepare all ingredients in bowls
2. Put mascarpone and joguhrt into one bowl and out back into fridge
3. Using a hand mixer whisk the heavy cream until you have stiff peaks
	1. Start on slow speed
	2. Once it starts getting a bit structured, increase speed to medium and than to fast
	3. Place into fridge.
4. **Using a whisk** **(~~NO MIXER~~)** beat the ***Mascarpone* and *Joguhrt*** until smooth. 
	1. Add the cooled gelatin mixture to the mascarpone and mix well
	2. Add in your powdered sugar, vanilla, lemon juice and lemon zest. Beat until smooth.
5. Gently fold the whipped cream into the mascarpone mixture. You want to be gentle as you don't want to deflate the air out of the whipped cream. This air is going to help keep your cheesecake light and fluffy!
6. Pour the cheesecake batter into your chilled crust. Use a small offset spatula to smooth out the top. Cover the top of the pan with plastic wrap and place in the fridge for at least 12 hours.
