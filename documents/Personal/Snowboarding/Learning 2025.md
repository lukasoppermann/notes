## Knee steering
Stacked position over the board. Face facing the direction of travel. Use the front knee to steer and put about 60% of your weight on lead foot.
- **Toe turn:** Squish the bug (move knee towards toes)
- **Heel turn:** Open the door (move knee towards front of the board, in a quarter circle)

## Carving
- Means having one edge in the snow and leaving a pencil thin line behind you, no breaking
- "Even weight" 60 / 40 on the front and the back foot
- This is the opposite of skidded turns
- Stay low with bend knees in the carves

#### Learn to carve
1. make sure you can flat base for a couple of seconds, because it means the center of mass is perfect over the board. If an edge engages your body position is not centered.
2. Toe turn from flatbase: **Bend knees** to press chins into front of boots
	- Complete one turn so that you are cutting a cross the slope and come to a stop

3. Heel turn from flatbase: Bend knees like sitting down, feel weight pushing down through heels

4. Practice both turns with increasing speed
5. Add **early edge change**
	- Go into toe turn
	- Once you go across slope (90deg to fall line)
	- Get up into tall position and sink down into back position for a heel turn
6. Keep linking turns by **moving center of mass up and over the board**

## Speed control using closed turns
- **Engage edge**
	- Go down in your knees to press the edge into the snow, this creates friction, which makes you slow down
	  ![](../../../attachments/Stop.gif)
- **Large turns up the run**
		- Making larger turns that go across or even partly up the run can help slow down again
	  ![](../../../attachments/CleanShot%202024-01-14%20at%2010.57.06@2x.png)
- **Speed checks**
		- quick, short breaking in between == board 90deg towards direction of travel
- **Edge pressure for speed**
		- Go down by bending your knees and extend them to push pressure into your edge to pick up some speed

## Strap in while standing
- Dig a platform with your snowboard so that you can safely stand on just the front foot
- **Better:** Push with your snowboard "heel" forward to create the platform

	- Now clean back foot, place in binding and strap in

## Skating / Snowboarding with one foot

##### Speed up
- To speed up, put back foot **behind** snowboard and push
	  ![](../../../attachments/CleanShot%202025-01-01%20at%2022.04.07@2x.png)
##### Ride
- Press back foot against binding from the inside
- Make sure back foot is completely on the board
	   ![](../../../attachments/CleanShot%202025-01-01%20at%2022.06.09@2x.png)
- Put most weight on front foot
##### Break
- Put back foot toe off board into snow to break

# Refresher

## Good position
![](../../../attachments/CleanShot%202025-01-02%20at%2013.12.19@2x.png)
- keep upper and lower body aligned
- **to practice** hold on to your pants while riding
	- ![](../../../attachments/CleanShot%202025-01-02%20at%2013.13.04@2x.png)

## Riding flats / catwalks
- Keep edge engaged, but only a little bit.
	- Rock from heel to toe edge and back
- Stand with your **knees bent, back straight and hands over the snowboard but your weight centred **both horizontally and vertically on the board
- If you **catch an edge**, this means the body position is not perfect
- Use need **knee steering to make turns** == 60% of your weight on the front foot
- To **slow down** turn (best onto heel edge) and break a bit
## T-Lift
![](../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020240118151500.png)
- front foot strapped in, back foot loose
- hold on the stick going into the rope (NOT T-part) with front hand (left hand) to keep your body aligned with direction of travel
- t between legs
- apply pressure to both toes to go into toe direction
- apply pressure to both heels to go into heel direction
- most of the time let your board guide you
