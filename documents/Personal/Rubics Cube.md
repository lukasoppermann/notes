## White cross

## White corners
- white face to bottom
- move corner over position on yellow face
- repeat the following algo until it fits

> R U R' U'

## 2nd Layer

- Move edge so that it aligns with face (e.g. orange blue is with blue side on top of blue face in the middle) and face this side
- turn U once away from fitting side (e.g. from so that it is on the red side)
- do algo once on second fitting side (e.g. orange)
> R U R' U' or L' U' L U
- turn cube to face second fitting side (e.g. orange) and do the inverse algo
> L' U' L U or R U R' U'

## Yellow cross

> F + R U R' U' = F'

repeat until you have the cross

## Yellow edges

- match **ONLY ONE** edge

repeat until they fit:

> R U R' U
> R U'Ã—2 R'

## Yellow corners
Put one matching corner to the front right and do the following algo:

> U R U' L'
> U R' U' L

## Solve 3rd layer
- rotate cube so that yellow face faces you
- you are solving the top right corner
- repeat the following algo until the the top right corner matches
> U R' U' R
- Rotate F until another corner that needs to be turned is in the top right position 
- repeat steps above until all corners match
- rotate F until cube is solved
