**Instructions:**
- Sive cornstarch and slowly mix it with half of the lemon juice
- In a saucepan, add the other half of the lemon juice, lemon zest and sugar and heat on **low flame** till sugar is dissolved (about 2-3 minutes).
- Slowly add the sieved corn starch and whisk well
- Increase to **medium heat** and keep whisking until the mixture starts to thicken (about 1-2 minutes).
- Add the butter and keep mixing till the butter is melted and you’ve reached your desired consistency. Switch off the flame.
- Pour it into a clean bowl and cover it with plastic wrap/cling such that it’s touching the top to avoid skin to form as it cools.
- Refrigerate the curd for at least 1 hour before using. 
	- **Important:** Don't cool it too much, max 4°C, never lower
	- The curd will continue to thicken as it cools. The curd can be refrigerated for up to 10 days.
